## Introduction : 🫵
Create software for a hospital system to remind patients via SMS when they need to take certain medicines. 

Imagine that your data is structured in a CSV in the following fashion:

Jane Peters, 16501231234, Insulin, 80mg, MWF

Jeff Goldberg, 16501235678, Amoxicillin, 40mg, TTh

An example CSV is provided in the project Github repository. The first entry can be read as "Jane Peters, whose phone 

number is 16501231234, needs to take a dose of 80mg of Insulin on each of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every week."

The second entry can similarly be read as "Jeff Goldberg, whose phone number is 16501235678, needs to take a 40mg 

dose of Amoxicillin on each of Tuesday and Thursday every week."

Use these entries to send SMS messages to each individual reminding them to take the prescribed amount of medicine 

each day they have to take it. For example, Jane should receive a SMS message on Wednesday with a message like: 

"Remember to take 80mg of Insulin today!"
